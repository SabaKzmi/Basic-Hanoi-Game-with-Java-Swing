# Tower of Hanoi Game
This repository contains a basic implementation of the Tower of Hanoi game in Java, with a graphical user interface created using Java Swing.
The game features a simple design with 5 disks, making it a great starting point for beginners interested in Java programming and GUI design.
## How to Play
The objective of the Tower of Hanoi game is to move all the disks from the leftmost peg to the rightmost peg, following these rules:
- Only one disk can be moved at a time.
- A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or an empty peg.
